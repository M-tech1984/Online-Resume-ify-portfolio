    I have been working as an ICT officer in Nigeria but since i relocated to England i have not been able to get IT related job role due to my lack of UK Experience in IT. My experiences 
    in IT convinced me that I would thoroughly enjoy pursuing a career In IT. In addition to this, I am a good communicator and have had a lot of experience dealing with clients. I have had 
    to cooperate with many individuals in differing roles in my work, which has also granted me an organizational mind-set. My strong attention to detail has also been an asset, and I wish to
     bring this to your organization if am given opportunity.
